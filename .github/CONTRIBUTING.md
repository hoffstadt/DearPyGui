# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. 

We would rather core library contributers hold off until we are finished making large changes to the backend, at which time we will update this document.

In the meantime the best ways to contribute:

- Improve the documentation
- Improve the wiki
- Offer feature suggestions
- Offer API suggestions
- Improve the demo app
- Report bugs
- Or anything else that helps this project move forward!

We appreciate any help and suggestions!
