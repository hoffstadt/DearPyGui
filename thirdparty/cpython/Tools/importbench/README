Importbench is a set of micro-benchmarks for various import scenarios.

It should not be used as an overall benchmark of import performance, but rather
an easy way to measure impact of possible code changes. For a real-world
benchmark of import, use the normal_startup benchmark from
https://github.com/python/performance
