# Pull Request title

It should be in the following format:

```
bpo-NNNN: Summary of the changes made
```

Where: bpo-NNNN refers to the issue number in the https://bugs.python.org.

Most PRs will require an issue number. Trivial changes, like fixing a typo, do not need an issue.

If this is a backport PR (PR made against branches other than `master`),
please ensure that the PR title is in the following format:

```
[X.Y] <title from the original PR> (GH-NNNN)
```

Where: [X.Y] is the branch name, e.g. [3.6].

GH-NNNN refers to the PR number from `master`.
