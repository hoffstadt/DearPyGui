Reverted the fix for https://bugs.python.org/issue42500 as it changed the

(visible on 32-bit platforms using binaries compiled using an earlier
version of Python 3.9.x headers).

Fixed bug where the :mod:`pdb` interactive run command echoed the args from
the shell command line, even if those have been overridden at the pdb
