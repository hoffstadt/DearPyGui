# Requirements to build the Python documentation

# Sphinx version is pinned so that new versions that introduce new warnings
# won't suddenly cause build failures. Updating the version is fine as long
# as no warnings are raised by doing so.
sphinx==2.4.4
# Docutils version is pinned to a version compatible with Sphinx
# version 2.4.4. It can be removed after bumping Sphinx version to at
# least 3.5.4.
docutils==0.17.1

blurb

# The theme used by the documentation is stored separately, so we need
# to install that as well.
