.. index:: pair: Environments; virtual

--------------

The :mod:`venv` module provides support for creating lightweight "virtual
environments" with their own site directories, optionally isolated from system
site directories.  Each virtual environment has its own Python binary (which
matches the version of the binary that was used to create this environment) and
can have its own independent set of installed Python packages in its site
directories.

See :pep:`405` for more information about Python virtual environments.

Creating virtual environments
-----------------------------

.. include:: /using/venv-create.inc


.. _venv-def:

.. note:: A virtual environment is a Python environment such that the Python
   interpreter, libraries and scripts installed into it are isolated from those
   installed in other virtual environments, and (by default) any libraries
   installed in a "system" Python, i.e., one which is installed as part of your
   operating system.

   A virtual environment is a directory tree which contains Python executable
   files and other files which indicate that it is a virtual environment.

   Common installation tools such as setuptools_ and pip_ work as
   expected with virtual environments. In other words, when a virtual
   environment is active, they install Python packages into the virtual
   environment without needing to be told to do so explicitly.

   When a virtual environment is active (i.e., the virtual environment's Python
   interpreter is running), the attributes :attr:`sys.prefix` and
   :attr:`sys.exec_prefix` point to the base directory of the virtual
   environment, whereas :attr:`sys.base_prefix` and
   :attr:`sys.base_exec_prefix` point to the non-virtual environment Python
   installation which was used to create the virtual environment. If a virtual
   environment is not active, then :attr:`sys.prefix` is the same as
   :attr:`sys.base_prefix` and :attr:`sys.exec_prefix` is the same as
   :attr:`sys.base_exec_prefix` (they all point to a non-virtual environment
   Python installation).

   When a virtual environment is active, any options that change the
   installation path will be ignored from all :mod:`distutils` configuration
   files to prevent projects being inadvertently installed outside of the
   virtual environment.

   When working in a command shell, users can make a virtual environment active
   by running an ``activate`` script in the virtual environment's executables
   directory (the precise filename and command to use the file is
   shell-dependent), which prepends the virtual environment's directory for
   executables to the ``PATH`` environment variable for the running shell. There
   should be no need in other circumstances to activate a virtual
   environment; scripts installed into virtual environments have a "shebang"
   line which points to the virtual environment's Python interpreter. This means
   that the script will run with that interpreter regardless of the value of
   ``PATH``. On Windows, "shebang" line processing is supported if you have the
   Python Launcher for Windows installed (this was added to Python in 3.3 - see
   :pep:`397` for more details). Thus, double-clicking an installed script in a
   Windows Explorer window should run the script with the correct interpreter
   without there needing to be any reference to its virtual environment in
   ``PATH``.


.. _venv-api:

API
---

.. highlight:: python

The high-level method described above makes use of a simple API which provides
mechanisms for third-party virtual environment creators to customize environment
creation according to their needs, the :class:`EnvBuilder` class.

.. class:: EnvBuilder(system_site_packages=False, clear=False, \
                      symlinks=False, upgrade=False, with_pip=False, \
                      prompt=None, upgrade_deps=False)

    The :class:`EnvBuilder` class accepts the following keyword arguments on
    instantiation:

    * ``system_site_packages`` -- a Boolean value indicating that the system Python
      site-packages should be available to the environment (defaults to ``False``).

    * ``clear`` -- a Boolean value which, if true, will delete the contents of
      any existing target directory, before creating the environment.

    * ``symlinks`` -- a Boolean value indicating whether to attempt to symlink the
      Python binary rather than copying.

    * ``upgrade`` -- a Boolean value which, if true, will upgrade an existing
      environment with the running Python - for use when that Python has been
      upgraded in-place (defaults to ``False``).

    * ``with_pip`` -- a Boolean value which, if true, ensures pip is
      installed in the virtual environment. This uses :mod:`ensurepip` with
      the ``--default-pip`` option.

    * ``prompt`` -- a String to be used after virtual environment is activated
      (defaults to ``None`` which means directory name of the environment would
      be used). If the special string ``"."`` is provided, the basename of the
      current directory is used as the prompt.

    * ``upgrade_deps`` -- Update the base venv modules to the latest on PyPI

    .. versionchanged:: 3.4
       Added the ``with_pip`` parameter

    .. versionadded:: 3.6
       Added the ``prompt`` parameter

    .. versionadded:: 3.9
       Added the ``upgrade_deps`` parameter

    Creators of third-party virtual environment tools will be free to use the
    provided :class:`EnvBuilder` class as a base class.

    The returned env-builder is an object which has a method, ``create``:

    .. method:: create(env_dir)

        Create a virtual environment by specifying the target directory
        (absolute or relative to the current directory) which is to contain the
        virtual environment.  The ``create`` method will either create the
        environment in the specified directory, or raise an appropriate
        exception.

        The ``create`` method of the :class:`EnvBuilder` class illustrates the
        hooks available for subclass customization::

            def create(self, env_dir):
                """
                Create a virtualized Python environment in a directory.
                env_dir is the target directory to create an environment in.
                """
                env_dir = os.path.abspath(env_dir)
                context = self.ensure_directories(env_dir)
                self.create_configuration(context)
                self.setup_python(context)
                self.setup_scripts(context)
                self.post_setup(context)

        Each of the methods :meth:`ensure_directories`,
        :meth:`create_configuration`, :meth:`setup_python`,
        :meth:`setup_scripts` and :meth:`post_setup` can be overridden.

    .. method:: ensure_directories(env_dir)

        Creates the environment directory and all necessary directories, and
        returns a context object.  This is just a holder for attributes (such as
        paths), for use by the other methods. The directories are allowed to
        exist already, as long as either ``clear`` or ``upgrade`` were
        specified to allow operating on an existing environment directory.

    .. method:: create_configuration(context)

        Creates the ``pyvenv.cfg`` configuration file in the environment.

    .. method:: setup_python(context)

        Creates a copy or symlink to the Python executable in the environment.
        On POSIX systems, if a specific executable ``python3.x`` was used,
        symlinks to ``python`` and ``python3`` will be created pointing to that
        executable, unless files with those names already exist.

    .. method:: setup_scripts(context)

        Installs activation scripts appropriate to the platform into the virtual
        environment.

    .. method:: upgrade_dependencies(context)

       Upgrades the core venv dependency packages (currently ``pip`` and
       ``setuptools``) in the environment. This is done by shelling out to the
       ``pip`` executable in the environment.

       .. versionadded:: 3.9

    .. method:: post_setup(context)

        A placeholder method which can be overridden in third party
        implementations to pre-install packages in the virtual environment or
        perform other post-creation steps.

    .. versionchanged:: 3.7.2
       Windows now uses redirector scripts for ``python[w].exe`` instead of
       copying the actual binaries. In 3.7.2 only :meth:`setup_python` does
       nothing unless running from a build in the source tree.

    .. versionchanged:: 3.7.3
       Windows copies the redirector scripts as part of :meth:`setup_python`
       instead of :meth:`setup_scripts`. This was not the case in 3.7.2.
       When using symlinks, the original executables will be linked.

    In addition, :class:`EnvBuilder` provides this utility method that can be
    called from :meth:`setup_scripts` or :meth:`post_setup` in subclasses to
    assist in installing custom scripts into the virtual environment.

    .. method:: install_scripts(context, path)

        *path* is the path to a directory that should contain subdirectories
        "common", "posix", "nt", each containing scripts destined for the bin
        directory in the environment.  The contents of "common" and the
        directory corresponding to :data:`os.name` are copied after some text
        replacement of placeholders:

        * ``__VENV_DIR__`` is replaced with the absolute path of the environment
          directory.

        * ``__VENV_NAME__`` is replaced with the environment name (final path
          segment of environment directory).

        * ``__VENV_PROMPT__`` is replaced with the prompt (the environment
          name surrounded by parentheses and with a following space)

        * ``__VENV_BIN_NAME__`` is replaced with the name of the bin directory
          (either ``bin`` or ``Scripts``).

        * ``__VENV_PYTHON__`` is replaced with the absolute path of the
          environment's executable.

        The directories are allowed to exist (for when an existing environment
        is being upgraded).

There is also a module-level convenience function:

.. function:: create(env_dir, system_site_packages=False, clear=False, \
                     symlinks=False, with_pip=False, prompt=None)

    Create an :class:`EnvBuilder` with the given keyword arguments, and call its
    :meth:`~EnvBuilder.create` method with the *env_dir* argument.

    .. versionadded:: 3.3

    .. versionchanged:: 3.4
       Added the ``with_pip`` parameter

    .. versionchanged:: 3.6
       Added the ``prompt`` parameter

An example of extending ``EnvBuilder``
--------------------------------------

The following script shows how to extend :class:`EnvBuilder` by implementing a
subclass which installs setuptools and pip into a created virtual environment::

    class ExtendedEnvBuilder(venv.EnvBuilder):
        """
        This builder installs setuptools and pip so that you can pip or
        easy_install other packages into the created virtual environment.

        :param nodist: If true, setuptools and pip are not installed into the
                       created virtual environment.
        :param nopip: If true, pip is not installed into the created
                      virtual environment.
        :param progress: If setuptools or pip are installed, the progress of the
                         installation can be monitored by passing a progress
                         callable. If specified, it is called with two
                         arguments: a string indicating some progress, and a
                         context indicating where the string is coming from.
                         The context argument can have one of three values:
                         'main', indicating that it is called from virtualize()
                         itself, and 'stdout' and 'stderr', which are obtained
                         by reading lines from the output streams of a subprocess
                         which is used to install the app.

                         If a callable is not specified, default progress
                         information is output to sys.stderr.
