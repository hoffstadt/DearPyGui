We'd love help and you are welcome to improve the the documentation with the exception of the api reference because 
it is currently generated manually from the stub file. It needs to be integrated within our CI process soon. 
If you'd like to change the API reference, update the stub file and we will generate the api docs during releases:

https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui/blob/master/DearPyGui/stubs/dearpygui.pyi


What can be modified related to docs:
* Wiki
* https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui/tree/gh-pages except (api_docs.html)
* Readme
* https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui/blob/master/DearPyGui/include/mvMarvel.h (this shows up in _show_documentation()_)
* https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui/blob/master/DearPyGui/src/Core/StandardWindows/mvDocWindow.cpp (this shows up in _show_documentation()_)
* https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui/tree/master/Examples (adding examples)

Currently the CSS formatting is inherited from the autogenerated AIP docs done using pdoc3 to keep uniformity.
