Item Creation
==============

DearPyGui can be broken down into **Items**, **UI Items**, **Containers**

Items
-----

Everything created in _Dear_PyGui_ is an **item**. New items can be created
by calling various *add_\*\*\** or *draw_\*\*\** functions. These commands
return a unique identifier that can be used to later refer to the item.
**UI items** and **containers** are also **items** - but not every **item**
is necessarily a **UI item** or **container**. Most items must be parented by another item.

All items have the following optional parameters: *label*, *id*, *user_data*,
and *use_internal_label*. The *id* is generated automatically and normally does
not need to be included. A *label* serves as the display name for an item, while
*user_data* can be any value and is frequently used for **callbacks**.


Containers
----------

**Container** items are used to parent and store other items
(including other containers).

In addition to creating them by
calling their corresponding *add_\*\*\** function, they can also be
created by calling their context manager function.

.. note:: Containers are more useful (and recommended) when used as context managers.

Below is an example of creating two new **window** items
using their context manager function and starting the application:

.. code-block:: python

    import dearpygui.dearpygui as dpg

    with dpg.window(label="Window1", pos=(0,0)) as window1:
        ...

    with dpg.window(label="Window2", pos=(100,0)) as window2:
        ...

    dpg.start_dearpygui()

UI Items
--------

**UI items** are items that are considered to be a visual
(and usually interactable) element in your user interface.
These include **buttons**, **sliders**, **inputs**, and even
other containers such as **windows** and **tree nodes**.

Below is an example for creating a **window** container
that parents a few other items:

.. code-block:: python

    import dearpygui.dearpygui as dpg


    with dpg.window(label="Tutorial") as window:
        # When creating items within the scope of the context
        # manager, they are automatically "parented" by the
        # container created in the initial call. So, "window"
        # will be the parent for all of these items.

        button1 = dpg.add_button(label="Press Me!")

        slider_int = dpg.add_slider_int(label="Slide to the left!",width=100)
        dpg.add_same_line(spacing=10)
        slider_float = dpg.add_slider_float(label="Slide to the right!",width=100)

        # An item's unique identifier (id) is returned when
        # creating items.
        print(f"Printing item id's: {window}, {button1}, {slider_int}, {slider_float}")

    # If you want to add an item to an existing container, you
    # can specify which by passing the container's id as the
    # "parent" parameter.
    button2=dpg.add_button(label="Don't forget me!", parent=window)

    dpg.start_dearpygui()

Other Items (i.e. everything else)
----------------------------------

Event **handlers**, **registries**, **group**, **same_line**, and **themes** are also items.
These are under-the-hood items for customizing the functionality, flow,
and overall look of your interface.
